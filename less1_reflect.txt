How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug 
that was introduced?

Viewing the diff between two versions of a file helped me focus olny on the
 changes made to the file. It was easier to find the needle because the ahystack was much smaller. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

i can be more experimental with ideas because i know that i have an untouched version backed up.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros:
more control over commit contents

cons:
more prone to "human error"

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git (being buit for code) realises that a change i one  file can effect separate, linking file so with one commit all file are saved to keep track of lined files effected by the change

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log can be used to list all commits. and git diff can show exactly what was changed between two commits.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to complete the android developer course on Udacity
