When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when you're working from more than one computer or when you have multiple people working together.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

it my pull changes that introduce bugs to your local file

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

clone is a copy of a repository. a fork is a clone that only exists on GitHub. a branch is a copy of commits inside a repository.
You fork a repo when you want to share your version with other computers. Similarly, you clone when you want the repo on the computer you're currently using. You branch after you already have the repo and you're ready to try out a new change to the file. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

works great for working off-line so you hae the last known state of the online version until you get back to the internet

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

i would probably use bitbucket but i don't know if it would be easier or not. I've never looked into it really.
